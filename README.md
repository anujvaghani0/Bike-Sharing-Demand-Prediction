# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction
<p align="justify">
Bike-sharing-demand-prediction refers to a type of project or task in the field of data science and machine learning that involves developing predictive models to estimate the demand for bike-sharing services</p>
<p align="justify">
Bike-sharing is a popular mode of transportation, particularly in urban areas, where people can rent bicycles for short periods of time to travel short distances, such as commuting to work, running errands, or exercising. Bike-sharing companies typically operate through mobile apps or kiosks, which allow users to rent and return bikes at various locations.</p>

<p align="justify"> The goal of bike-sharing-demand-prediction is to create accurate and reliable models that can forecast the demand for bike-sharing services based on various factors, such as time of day, day of week, weather conditions, and location. These models can be used by bike-sharing companies to optimize their operations, such as determining the number of bikes to make available at different locations, adjusting pricing and promotions, and improving customer satisfaction. </p>

<p align="justify">
To build a bike-sharing-demand-prediction model, data scientists typically start by collecting historical data on bike usage, as well as data on other relevant variables, such as weather conditions and public events. They then preprocess and clean the data, select appropriate features, and train and test various machine learning algorithms to find the best model. Finally, the model is deployed and evaluated on new data to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness.</p>
